Files provided include the weights, stored as a numpy file, as well as "Custom Number.py", downloading these files will allow you to draw your own numbers and input them into the neural network to see if it can correctly classify your handwriting.
Also provided is the py file used to generate the weights, however the MNIST dataset is not provided and can be found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
